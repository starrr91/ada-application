# Welcome to My GitHub

### I'm currently a Marketing Specialist at a computer hardware company. With a Bachelor's degree in Journalism and a Master's degree in Public Relations, I've been immersed myself in the world of communication for almost 8 years.  
### One day I woke up and it just hit me that "I have the total control of my life and there's so many things out there that I might not be able to experience for the limited time I have". I have to at least try to achieve something, to experience something totally different.  
### That's not the story of why I'd like to join Ada Developers Academy.
